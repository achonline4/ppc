/*
This is the function you need to implement. Quick reference:
- input rows: 0 <= y < ny
- input columns: 0 <= x < nx
- element at row y and column x is stored in data[x + y*nx]
- correlation between rows i and row j has to be stored in result[i + j*ny]
- only parts with 0 <= j <= i < ny need to be filled
*/

/*
 * Steps - 
 * 1. Calculate mean of each row. Each row is treated like an array.
 * 2. Calculate deviation from mean for each element and store it in the result the same way data is stored. Don't need to store it just do a += since we have to sum the deviation for the row and summation of their squares, dev_sum_ri, dev_sum_rj, dev_sq_sum_ri, dev_sq_sum_rj.
 * 3.
